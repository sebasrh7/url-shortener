# Url Shortener

## Description

This is a simple URL shortener that takes a long URL and returns a shortened version of it. The shortened URL is a base62 encoded string that is generated by hashing the long URL. The shortened URL is stored in a database and can be accessed by appending the shortened URL to the base URL.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/url-shortener
```

4. Run `npm start` to start the server

## Usage

1. Send a POST request to the `/shorten` endpoint with the long URL in the request body
2. The server will return a shortened URL
3. Append the shortened URL to the base URL to access the long URL

## Example

1. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/shorten` with the following request body:

```
{
    "url": "https://www.google.com"
}
```

2. The server will return a shortened URL, for example: `http://localhost:3000/abc123`
3. Access the long URL by going to `http://localhost:3000/abc123`
